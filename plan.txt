update routes. rather than accounts have settings. get or post new settings.

spaces in id names not valid html5. eg: <tr id="{{category}}-{{.}}">. possible solution change seetings object so each cat/subcat is an object with name and id. other option dont allow spaces in cat/subcat names.

set initial accounts in ls. if no key exists will throw error from getitem?
store accounts/cats in localstorage. get set

create authenticated api and host on heroku. node.js jwt mdb.
once this works can use react or vanilla js to build frontend.
